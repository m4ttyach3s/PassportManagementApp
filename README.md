# Passport Service App
Repository of a passport management app written and developed for my Software Engineering course.
The project got the highest grade.
The documentation will be uploaded to this repo.
The app is fully written in Java; the GUI was created using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, SceneBuilder, and its use of FXML files.
PostgreSQL and PGAdmin 4 are used for handling data.
The project follows an MVC approach.
